This is a very facile web server implementation. It only serves static files,
in the simplest way possible (though it does make an effort to determine the
correct MIME type for the content being returned). It does not support any of
the HTTP specification other than the simplest GET retrieval of a static
resource and does no real parsing of HTTP. It also does not support any sort
of chunked encoding or sophisticated handling of large files, so it will do
terrible things to your RAM utilization if you attempt to deliver very large
files.

That said, for what it is, it's a very simple, functional static file server
that illustrates doing something useful with the SimpleReactor implementation,
with performance that is respectably quick.
