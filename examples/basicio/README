This provides a very simple example of an echo type server. When started,
it simultaneously listens for input from STDIN, and for input from a
TCP port. When an HTTP request is received on the TCP port, an HTTP response
is sent containing whatever has been entered from STDIN as the response.

Note that this is NOT even close to an actual functional web server
implementation. It makes no effort to parse anything, and simply responds
to a connection with an HTTP response.
