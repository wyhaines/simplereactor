puts <<ETXT
Type some text and press after each line. The reactor is attached to
STDIN and also port 9949, where it listens for any connection and responds with
a basic HTTP response containing whatever has been typed to that point. These
two dramatically different IO streams are being handled simultaneously. Type
to exit, or wait one minute, and a timer will fire which causes the
reactor to stop and the program to exit.
